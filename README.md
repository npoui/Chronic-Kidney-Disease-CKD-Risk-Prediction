# Chronic-Kidney-Disease-CKD-Risk-Prediction
This project predicts Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) risk based on patient clinical data and nephrotoxic drug information using Machine Learning models.  The dataset is sourced from Kaggle: CKD Nephrotoxic Drug Dataset

 Dataset
- Source: Kaggle
- File used:
  - `CKD_NephrotoxicDrug_Dataset.csv`
- Target variable:
  - `ckd_risk_label`
    - 0 → No CKD
    - 1 → CKD

Dataset is not included in the repository due to size constraints.

Models Used

- **Random Forest Classifier**
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**

Methodology

1. Load and inspect dataset
2. Handle missing values and duplicates
3. Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
4. One-hot encoding of categorical variables
5. Feature scaling using StandardScaler
6. Train-test split (80–20)
7. Model training
8. Performance evaluation using accuracy score
9. CKD prediction for new patient input
